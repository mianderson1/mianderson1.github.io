			<h2>TO THE BUCK TEAM,</h2>
			<h1>I’m applying for the Design Apprenticeship position at&nbsp;Buck.</h1>

			 <p>I’m in awe of your work — especially your campaign for Spotify — and have heard great things from Kirk Johnson, a friend and an art director at Buck. Multiple contacts have told me about their respect for your company’s work, so I’m excited to begin this correspondence.</p>

					<h5>ABOVE&nbsp;</h5><p>&nbsp;These two renderings for Buck’s Spotify campaign especially impressed me. The style manages to feel simultaneously modern — with its sleek, simple forms — and retro — the moving grid recalls the&nbsp;film&nbsp;<i>Tron</i>.</p>

			 <p>I’ve already been working for several years, and, three years ago, I decided that I wanted to pivot to more meaningful work. Since then, I’ve completed several advanced courses in Visual Media Design — and am now a few weeks away from earning a certificate — and have even built a freelance business of my own: I design websites, illustrations, and logos  for clients in tech, sports, and the arts.</p>

 			<p>I’d be an asset on your Design team not only because of my visual style but also because of what I offer beyond visual design: I've spent the last nine years working as a Content Marketer, Writer, and Operations professional for media and tech companies, so I know Content and Audience from a text and copywriting perspective. And I can wear a lot of hats.</p> 
			
			<p>My comprehensive, diverse perspectives have served me well in my freelance work. I think in particular of my work for Yes, one of my current projects where I serve as graphic designer — and occasional copywriter or project manager. Yes is a store that will soon open its doors at Castro and Market Streets in San Francisco, and it’s essentially a semi-permanent craft fair: a multi-vendor space with high-quality furniture, clothing, food, and beverage, and a place where customers can meet the artisans themselves. A few weeks ago, when I got word that my client needed a new website A.S.A.P. — they needed it “yesterday,” they said — I designed wireframes for their web pages and even wrote their Mission Statement and some other accompanying copy within 45 minutes. This multi-disciplinary perspective is what would make me a strong contributor on your team.</p>

			<p>I want to work at Buck for all the aforementioned reasons — the quality of your work for clients like Spotify, the caliber of your team per my friend Kirk. I also am generally interested in agency work because of their reputation as a place to learn. I thrive when I feel challenged, so I’m eager and excited to dive deep in that next position.</p>

			<p>Thanks for your time. I’m looking forward to continuing this conversation.</p>
